## Instructions

1. Apply Cynefin classification to understand the complexity of changes
2. Perform dependency mapping - identify all consumers of modified code
3. Verify API contracts - check if signatures, return types, or data structures changed
4. Check for regressions, race conditions, and logic errors
5. Ensure domain boundaries are respected (no business logic in UI/infra layers)
